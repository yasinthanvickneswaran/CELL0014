**Exploration of the Genetic Toggle Switch**


Report brief:
Demonstrate, discuss and evaluate how different modelling work was utilised to explore and
understand the behaviour of the Genetic Toggle Switch.
You should use your own model investigations and results. In your work you should use the model
structure and parameter values taken from the later work by Lugange et al.
The suggested word count for the report is 2000-2500 words, however word count penalties will not
be applied.
Your report must include the following parts:
1. Exploration of Repressor Kinetics used in the Toggle Switch Model
i) investigation of expressed protein level under control of repressor, and the meaning of the model
parameters
2. Analysis of the Toggle Switch system
i) demonstration of bistable behaviour
ii) exploration of the relationship between co-operativity of repression and system bistability
iii) Phase space analysis of the system (using simplified reduced model)
3. Investigation of the experimental Toggle Switch system implemented by Lugange et al.
i) simulation of the experimental Toggle Switch using parameters as determined by Lugange et al.
ii) investigation of this system and its behaviour when simulated stochastically and comparison to the
deterministic results.
You should read into the related literature of this work and its context, and a strong report write up is
will critically evaluate the results and expected to demonstrate a sound understanding of the work
completed. For example you would be expected to:
- Demonstrate a good understanding of the models used, e.g. how they are constructed; what the
terms relate to; how parameter values have been assigned; relevant assumptions and
weaknesses.
- Discuss, explain and evaluate the results in relation to the knowledge of systems modelling
principles as covered in the module, e.g. explaining why a reduced model is needed and how the
reduction is possible, discussing the different results obtained by deterministic and stochastic
methods or how modelling analysis aids experimental lab work.
- Provide insights into the results (e.g. their uses / implications / strengths / weaknesses, or links
between your results and other reported work) in the context of the experimental work on the
Toggle Switch and Synthetic Biology in general.
